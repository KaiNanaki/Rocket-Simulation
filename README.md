Rocket Landing Simulation

This assignment was a rocket landing problem where we had to determine the altitude that the rocket thruster needed to fire in order to touchdown on a planet at a speed that would not destroy the rocket on impact.
This program was part of the assignment and is used to show a successful landing at the altitude determined in our equation from the Mathematics class. Extra functionality was added outside of our spec so that equation values could be changed.

Please note: 
I wrote the Rocket class and the main code file for this project. The 'Forminput' class was written by the other member of my group on this project (DP).
